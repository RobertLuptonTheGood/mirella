                     It was her voice 
            That made the sky acutest at its vanishing.
            She measured to the hour its solitude.
            She was the single artificer of the world
            In which she sang. And when she sang, the sea,
            Whatever self it had, became the self
            That was her song, for she was maker. Then we,
            As we beheld her striding there alone,
            Knew that never was a world for her
            Except the one she sang and, singing, made.

                                    -- Wallace Stevens
